                  Before I began my desktop Linux journey, I feared the command
                  line. Now I'm learning to embrace it as a fast, flexible tool
                  that grants you the power to accomplish exactly what you want
                  to do with your computer. And since beginning my desktop Linux
                  journey, I've had an aversion to Xfce. You know, that desktop
                  environment with the cute mouse that's self-described as
                  "visually appealing" and light on system resources. Every time
                  I've brushed up against it, I've bristled and immediately
                  installed or downloaded an alternative. But opinions can
                  change if you don't judge a book (or in this case a desktop
                  environment) by its cover.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  My Choose Linux co-host Joe Ressington swears by
                  <strong>Xfce</strong>. He has no interest in eye candy. He
                  simply wants to get his production work done. I also
                  appreciate a distraction-free environment (like elementary
                  OS), but I crave a bit of elegance and visuals that don't bore
                  me.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  Every time I looked at screenshots of Xfce, though -- even
                  from the official website -- I was reminded of something from
                  the days of Windows 2000. Grey. Archaic. Uninteresting. It
                  struck me as as one of the few alternatives people with anemic
                  PCs are forced to use. <strong>MATE</strong> is one of those
                  alternatives, but it comes off as sharper and more modern
                  despite also thriving on low-end hardware. Even if it is
                  obsessed with the color green.
                </p>

                  This week I finally got worn down, and Joe suggested I install
                  this Manjaro's flagship edition with Xfce.
                  <q
                    cite="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/04/08/manjaro-18-linux-gaming-report-this-is-the-desktop-linux-distro-to-beat/"
                  >
                    it boasts the best implementation of Xfce he's ever seen.
                  </q>
                  He promised. I'm not remotely opposed to using Manjaro after
                  having an overwhelmingly positive experience during my Linux
                  Gaming Report, so I took the plunge.
                </p>
                <h3 class="article-inner-titles">
                  Is Xfce My New Desktop Environment?
                </h3>
                <p class="article-text">
                  I'm impressed, and I'm glad that pesky co-host of mine kept
                  hounding me to give Xfce a chance. I know it's was a popular
                  choice for Linux users, but I think the folks behind Xfce may
                  be doing it a disservice by not aggressively highlighting what
                  it's capable of. I didn't find a single screenshot on the Xfce
                  homepage that would even tempt me into trying it. And its
                  default implementation on other distros doesn't exactly get my
                  eyes drooling.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  But when you peel away the surface impressions, look beyond
                  that proverbial book cover, Xfce apparently rocks and it
                  shouldn't be viewed as an archaic-looking desktop suitable
                  only for older hardware. It seems well-suited to just about
                  anyone, provided you're willing to get your hands dirty and
                  make it your own.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  And now I'm faced with a difficult choice: do I stick with the
                  excellent iteration of Gnome on <u>Pop!_OS</u> , or throw Xfce
                  on top? Or perhaps I entertain Manjaro Xfce as my new daily
                  driver (after all, it does nail the gaming element)? For now,
                  perhaps both. What a strange, wonderful journey this is.
