                  When I first heard that KDE Plasma 6 was on the way, I
                  immediately assumed it would be a major release with big
                  changes. After all, the development and design team rarely
                  fails to make a splash with a new release.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  But when I downloaded the unstable version of KDE Neon (which
                  includes KDE Plasma 6), I was quite surprised to find the
                  default layout and functionality to seem just as it was with
                  the previous iteration.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  Yes, there are some subtle differences (such as defaulting to
                  double-clicks on the desktop instead of the traditional KDE
                  Plasma single click) but overall KDE Plasma looked and felt
                  like KDE Plasma. Of course, you must keep in mind this is an
                  early-release version on an unstable distribution, so not only
                  will there be bugs, but it will also feel somewhat incomplete.
                  But I was taken aback by things like a proposed default
                  floating panel that wasn't floating. It wasn't until I read
                  the list of what's coming that I realized that KDE Plasma 6
                  isn't really what one might consider to be a major step
                  forward but, rather, a bunch of baby steps forward.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  We (as users and aficionados) reached a point, years ago,
                  where we expect every major software release to be filled with
                  magic, wow factor, and more panache than Cyrano de Bergerac.
                  For a while, this idea became so prevalent that it pressured
                  developers into adding features and making changes that simply
                  didn't make sense. They were changes for the sake of change
                  and that rarely equates to a positive user experience.

                  You see, as it stands KDE Plasma is an amazing desktop.
                  Although it might not be my desktop of choice, it is one of
                  the Linux desktops I often recommend the most, especially to
                  those coming from Windows. KDE Plasma is equal parts elegance
                  and functionality, so making major changes to the platform
                  would be a mistake. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the baby
                  steps the KDE Plasma developers take with each release (major
                  or minor) is the exact right approach.

                  People loved GNOME 2. It was fast, reliable, flexible, and
                  very easy to use. People were accustomed to how GNOME 2 worked
                  and were content. But the developers were looking toward the
                  future (a future I'm certain they were convinced where we'd
                  see the end of the transition mouse in favor of touch
                  screens). The jump from the final GNOME 2.x to GNOME 3 was
                  dramatic and a lot of people were unhappy. In fact, so many
                  people disliked this "out-of-nowhere" new direction, they
                  jumped ship. The reaction was so strong, a fork of GNOME 2
                  came about which gave birth to Linux Mint and the Cinnamon
                  desktop.

                  If I had to guess -- given the major underpinnings coming to
                  KDE Plasma 6 (X.org and Qt6) -- we'll find KDE Plasma 7 a more
                  earth-shattering release than 6. By the time 7 comes around,
                  both Wayland and Qt6 will be perfectly in tune with KDE Plasma
                  and the developers will feel they can be a bit bolder with new
                  features and changes.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">
                  Until that time however, come February 2024, you'll be able to
                  enjoy an even more polished KDE Plasma desktop, with just the
                  right amount of tweaks and improvements to make your favorite
                  open-source desktop even better.
